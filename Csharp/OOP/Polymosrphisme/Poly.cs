            Polymorphism in C# refers to the ability of an object to take on multiple form


            C# supports two types of polymorphism:

            **** compile-time polymorphism **** (also known as method overloading) : Method overloading allows multiple methods to have the same name, but with different parameters. The compiler selects the appropriate method to call based on the number, types, and order of the parameters.

            **** Runtime polymorphism ***** (also known as method overriding): Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class. The method in the subclass must have the same signature (name, return type, and parameters) as the method in the parent class.


            ***** inheritance ***** is also a form of polymorphism known as "subtyping" or "subtype polymorphism".
